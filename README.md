# facial-keypoints-detection
This repo contains code that detects facial keypoints (such as the center of the eyes, the nose, upper and lower lips, eyebrows etc.) in images. Full details of the data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/facial-keypoints-detection/overview

We train a convolutional neural network to identify these facial keypoints.
